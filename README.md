# techdegree-project-03

    This project is the Unit 03 Project of the Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Techdegree.

    The javascript file adds form validation and interactivity to the various inputs throughout
    the form found in index.html. The code provides real-time notifications (through color changes) on the validity of
    input as the user is entering data.

    If the user attempts to submit the form without inputting valid data into the available fields
    the user is notified with each invalid input element changing color and background color (where applicable).
    Once the user successfully enters valid data into each available input field, the form may be submitted.
